# Introduction:

In March 2020, multiple counties in California issued a lockdown in response to Covid-19. People halted their everyday activities, industries and travel paused their productions, and businesses shut down due to loss of income. As a result, the air quality improved, consumption of fossil fuel and nonrenewable energy sources was reduced, and recovery of the ecosystems. These positive effects on the environment demonstrated a solution for society to reduce the rate of climate change. Our project aimed to explore the impact of the pandemic on the environment, more specifically, how the pandemic impacted air pollution in California. We chose to investigate the change of three air pollutants - Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). We gathered past records of air pollutant levels from 2015 to 2020 to create prediction models that estimate future air pollutant levels under pandemic conditions and applied exploratory analysis to demonstrate a change in air pollutant levels. In addition, we built an interactive dashboard model of all the contributors to climate change and the impact the lockdown measures had across California.
